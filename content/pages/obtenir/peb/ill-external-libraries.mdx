# ILL Service for External Libraries

We currently use OCLC WorldShare Tipasa. If your ILL system is not compatible, you can send an ILL request for loan or copy by filling out the form below.

## How to Send ILL Requests

Before using the form for the first time, a login account is needed.

### Create an Account

* Fill out the [registration form](https://pbuq.libwizard.com/f/Registration_ILL_services) for your library.
* Our team will create your account and send you a confirmation email with instructions for account activation. Please note a delay is possible.
* Complete the registration in the next 24 hours after receiving the email.

### Send an ILL Request

With your account, you will be able to send us an ILL request via this [form](https://42113.account.worldcat.org/account/route/lending/workform).

Please note the old Colombo VDX form is no longer used, and ILL requests cannot be sent by email.

## Exclusions

* Entire online books
* CD-ROMs
* Games, toys, and other didactic material
* Documents for in-library use only
* Reserved materials
* Rare and special collections

We may refuse an ILL request for other reasons, such as fragility, research or patrimonial value, or use.
